transfer counter register

32 bits, resides at 0x00008 on the "user" device path (this spits out axi-lite out of the xdma core and converts to GPIO)

        private void UpdateBufferHead()
        {
            // 1 page = 4k
            uint transfer_counter = Read32(BarRegister.DATAMOVER_TRANSFER_COUNTER);
            uint error_code = transfer_counter >> 30;
            if ((error_code & 2) > 0)
                throw new Exception("Thunderscope - datamover error");

            if ((error_code & 1) > 0)
                throw new ThunderscopeFifoOverflowException("Thunderscope - FIFO overflow");

            uint overflow_cycles = transfer_counter >> 16 & 0x3FFF;
            if (overflow_cycles > 0)
                throw new Exception("Thunderscope - pipeline overflow");

            uint pages_moved = transfer_counter & 0xFFFF;
            ulong buffer_head = hardwareState.BufferHead & ~0xFFFFUL | pages_moved;
            if (buffer_head < hardwareState.BufferHead)
                buffer_head += 0x10000UL;

            hardwareState.BufferHead = buffer_head;

            ulong pages_available = hardwareState.BufferHead - hardwareState.BufferTail;
            if (pages_available >= hardwareState.RamSizePages)
                throw new ThunderscopeMemoryOutOfMemoryException("Thunderscope - memory full");
        }

bit 31 - datamover error
- this is death, very odd error that seems to persist after power off, no idea why - haven't seen it in a long time, may have been fixed in latest gateware
bit 30 - FIFO overflow
- this is the fifo in front of the datamover, if this overflows, its a problem in DRAM (should never happen! - haven't seen since fixed in latest gateware)

bits 29-16 - overflow cycles
- how many cycles did it overflow for - only for debugging, this is covered by the sticky bit 30 FIFO error

bits 15-0 - pages_moved - how many 4kB transfers the datamover has written into the ddr3
- if this value - it's value at the last read is over the ddr3 size, that's a "scope out of memory error"
- essentialy a FIFO overflow for the ddr3, which we have to set up software side as a circular buffer
